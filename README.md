## What is Autoencoder (AE)?

[Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html)

## Three Steps

- **Step 1**: Train Autoencoders on two datasets (**Train 1**)
  - MNIST
  - HandSign (from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.floydhub.com/deeplearningai/datasets/signs))
- **Step 2**: Train neural network that link two latent layers (**Train 2**)
- **Step 3**: **Reconstruct** the model

### Tricks - Use pre-trained classification model

Both of our datasets are images, usually we use convolutional neural network (**CNN**) to extract the feature in the images. There are many instances/examples that use CNN to perform classification/recognizing for both datasets and can get pretty good result.

So maybe the CNN model, which was trained for classification, already "learned" the latent representation of the data.

If that is true, the our **Step 1** will be separated into two step:
- Step 1a: Build CNN model for classification
- Step 1b: Use pre-trained model to build AE (Drop top layer, fix weight)

There is a very good code example that [jointly train autoencoder and classifier](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/10037#issuecomment-387213211). In fact, this code train a classifier and autoencoder simultaneously, but I think "train a classifier - fix weight - train a autoencoder (decoder)" is a different case (Am I right?).

### Build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

-- Recognize (Classification) HandSign and HandWrite (MNIST) images

#### For MNIST dataset

A piece of cake.

```python
# pseudo-code
model = Sequential()
model.add( Conv2D(32,
    kernel_size=3,
    activation='relu',
    padding='same',
    input_shape=(28,28,1))
)
model.add( MaxPooling2D() )
model.add( Dropout(0.2) )

model.add( Conv2D(64,
    kernel_size=3,
    activation='relu',
    padding='same')
)
model.add( MaxPooling2D() )
model.add( Dropout(0.2) )

model.add( Flatten() )
model.add( Dense(32, activation='relu')
model.add( Dense(10, activation='softmax') )

model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer='adadelta',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

model.fit( epochs=10 ...)
model.evaluate(...)
# Test accuracy: 0.9921
```

#### For HandSign dataset

The HandSign dataset is

### Tricks - Data Augmentation

### Build Autoencoders from CNN

## Linked Latent Layer

-- Just a simple Neural Network

## Additional - VAE

#### PS

This idea was raise up when I was processing single cell DNA sequencing data.

If you treat the call segment process, which usually use CBS or HMM algorithm, as a dimensional reduction process from the raw copy number data, then maybe you can use a AE to do that.

So I thought I need two AE, one for "dimensional reduction" the raw data, the other one for "dimensional reduction" the segment data (generated by CBS/HMM as training set). Then, use a neural network to link two latent layers.

To do that, first I will try this idea on machine learning benchmark dataset (MNIST), then I will try on real (DNA sequencing) dataset.

If it works, I will create another repository. Hopefully, we can get a neural network version of segment caller!

This repository is a branch from a **Private** repository.
