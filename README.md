# Linked Autoencoders - by Keras

## Summary

![](./imgs/Linked_Autoencoders.jpg)

## Build Autoencoders

-- Based on pre-trained CNN model for classification

### Tricks - Use pre-trained classification model

### Build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

-- Recognize (Classification) HandSign and HandWrite (MNIST) images

### Tricks - Data Augmentation

---


---

## Linked Latent Layer

-- Just a simple Neural Network


---

## Additional - VAE

#### PS

This idea was raise up when I was processing single cell DNA sequencing data.

If you treat the call segment process, which usually use CBS or HMM algorithm, as a dimensional reduction process from the raw copy number data, then maybe you can use a AE to do that.

So I thought I need two AE, one for "dimensional reduction" the raw data, the other one for "dimensional reduction" the segment data (generated by CBS/HMM as training set). Then, use a neural network to link two latent layers.

To do that, first I will try this idea on machine learning benchmark dataset (MNIST), then I will try on real (DNA sequencing) dataset.

If it works, I will create another repository. Hopefully, we can get a neural network version of segment caller!

#### BTW

This repository is a branch from a **Private** repository.
